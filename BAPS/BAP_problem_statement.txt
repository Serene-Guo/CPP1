this project is to solve the Berth Allocation Problem. 

This problem is to allocation of the coming vessels. 

THere are many sections of wharf in a port. The vessels arriving at a port are berthed in a section, and the containers they ferry are transferred to other vessels or to the port. 

Aim to find good berth allocations so as to minimise the movement of containers traffic across sections.
